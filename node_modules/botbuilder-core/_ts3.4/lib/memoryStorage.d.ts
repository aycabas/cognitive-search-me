 * Memory based storage provider for a bot.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This provider is most useful for simulating production storage when running locally against the
 * emulator or as part of a unit test. It has the following characteristics:
 *
 * - Starts off completely empty when the bot is run.
 * - Anything written to the store will be forgotten when the process exits.
 * - Objects that are read and written to the store are cloned to properly simulate network based
 *   storage providers.
 * - Cloned objects are serialized using `JSON.stringify()` to catch any possible serialization
 *   related issues that might occur when using a network based storage provider.
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');
 *
 * const storage = new MemoryStorage();
 * ```
